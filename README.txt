HALLO :>
My name is Ben, I am a University student studying Computer Security @ University, I also plan on getting a teaching degree :>
this is my personal game dev project I am working on
I have always had an interest in big number games, and idle games. I find them a cathartic release from dealing with whatever BS is going on and turning off my brain.
Hopefully you can enjoy this game, if there are any error email me at: relaximadev@gmail.com
YOU MUST DOWNLOAD PYTHON 3.xx.x TO RUN THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS TKINTER (because I am dumb and idk how to make a window manually)

This game is inspired by other incremental games, some are:
Synergism
Incremental Mass Rewritten
Those garbage roblox incrementals that I play wayyyyy too much :/
And more that I will add when I remember them


I also have some socials if you want to check them out:

***Will add more once I decide to make other ones***
