HALLO :>
My name is Ben, I am a Computer Security student, and am planning on getting a teaching degree after
this is my personal game dev project I am working on
I have always had an interest in big number games, and idle games. I find them a cathartic release from dealing with whatever BS is going on and turning off my brain.
Hopefully you can enjoy this game, if there are any error email me at: relaximadev@gmail.com
